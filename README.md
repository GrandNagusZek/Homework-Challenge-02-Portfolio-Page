# Homework-Challenge-02-Portfolio-Page


## Description
A web developer's portfolio serves as a showcase of their skills, projects, and experiences. It plays a crucial role in the professional identity and career development of a web developer. To that end, this is my first attempt at creating a portfolio. This is just the first attempt and I hope to continue to return to this project as I improve in my coding skills and experience and apply that knowledge to make it a showcase for my skills and proficiency in various web development technologies, languages, and frameworks. Please feel free to provide any insights, constructive critiques, and any comments that I can use and adapt to improve myself and my work as a web developer.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge one key resource for this webpage and that is the developer ajlkn (link to his webpage: https://aj.lkn.io) and his GitHub repo: https://github.com/ajlkn

I found his projects, his site html5up.net, which is an HTML template site. He provides his templates under a 100% free creative common license. I was inspired by his designs, I decided to try to build one of his templates in an effort to learn for myself how to structure HTML and apply CSS styles to achieve the same
look. I went through the HTML line by line writing and understanding the layout. Editing parts which did not apply to my project or which were beyond my scope of my current abilities.

There are some scripts included in his template that I have not implemented on my portfolio site because I haven't learned those languages as of the publishing of this assignment/homework. I plan on returning to this project thoughout the bootcamp
I am attending and applying what I learn to improve my portfolio 
Give credit to any libraries, resources, or individuals that inspired or helped the project.
