# Homework-Challenge-02-Portfolio-Page


## Description
A web developer's portfolio serves as a showcase of their skills, projects, and experiences. It plays a crucial role in the professional identity and career development of a web developer. To that end, this is my first attempt at creating a portfolio. This is just the first attempt and I hope to continue to return to this project as I improve in my coding skills and experience and apply that knowledge to make it a showcase for my skills and proficiency in various web development technologies, languages, and frameworks. Please feel free to provide any insights, constructive critiques, and any comments that I can use and adapt to improve myself and my work as a web developer.
