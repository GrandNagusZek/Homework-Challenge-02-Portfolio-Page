        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Jersey City, New Jersey, I earned a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts with a minor in Asian Studies. A recipient of a full scholarship, I pursued my passion for linguistics and the Chinese language at Zhejiang University in China, obtaining a master's degree.

            Embracing the challenges of living abroad, I taught English in China for several years. The experience fueled my entrepreneurial spirit, leading me to establish an English training school. However, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a return to the United States, marking a pivotal moment in my life.
            
            Back in the U.S., I faced a crossroads and decided to shift my career towards full-stack web development. Motivated by a passion for coding and a vision for the future, I am currently navigating the dynamic world of web development in South Florida.
            
            Balancing my aspirations with family life, I take pride in being a loving spouse and a devoted parent to two wonderful children. Their unwavering support propels me forward as I strive to master diverse technologies and contribute to the tech community.
            
            My journey, from academic pursuits in China to entrepreneurial ventures and a career transition, reflects a commitment to growth, adaptability, and the pursuit of excellence. As I navigate the ever-evolving chapters of my life, I remain steadfast in my belief that education, innovation, and community building are the cornerstones of a fulfilling and impactful existence.</p>
