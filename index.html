                    <p>Born and raised in the vibrant city of Jersey City, I embarked on a journey that has woven together my passions for language, culture, and education. Armed with a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and a minor in Asian Studies, I earned a full scholarship to pursue higher education at the prestigious Zhejiang University in China. There, I delved into the intricacies of linguistics and the Chinese language, earning a master's degree that enriched my understanding of global communication.</p>

                        <p>My professional journey took a transformative turn as I ventured into teaching English in China for several fulfilling years. The experience was not merely about imparting linguistic knowledge but fostering cross-cultural understanding. Inspired by this, I took a leap of faith, establishing my own English training school, where language became a bridge connecting diverse minds.</p>
                        
                        <p>The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a return to my roots in the United States. Eager for a fresh start, I set my sights on a new horizon—web development. Driven by a curiosity to explore the digital realm, I am currently navigating the exciting terrain of becoming a full-stack web developer. The transition represents not just a career shift but a passionate embrace of the dynamic world of coding and creation.</p>
                        
                        <p>In my personal life, I am blessed with a loving family—married with two wonderful children—who provide constant support and inspiration. Settled in the warmth of South Florida, I am immersed in the vibrant tech community, actively learning and building projects that marry my linguistic background with the endless possibilities of web development. This journey embodies my enthusiasm for continuous learning, cultural exchange, and the transformative power of technology. With each line of code, I embark on a new chapter, shaping a future where language, education, and technology converge to create meaningful and impactful experiences.</p>
